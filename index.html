                <p>Sakura is a very cute, energetic, cheerful and tomboyish ten-year-old girl. She is very athletic,
                    being a
                    member of her school's cheer-leading squad, an excellent runner, a trait she inherited from her
                    father,
                    a very tough fighter and was very good at sports and video gaming. Her "invincible spell"
                    "Everything
                    will surely be all right" ("絶対大丈夫だよ" "Zettai daijoubu da yo") has carried her through innumerable
                    trials
                    and obstacles as she masters her magical skills. </p>

                <h3 class="pink-color">Male lead</h3>
                <p>Syaoran Li is initially a cold and cynical ten-year-old boy. As the heir of the famous Li clan of
                    sorcerers from Hong Kong, of which Clow Reed's mother herself was also a member, Syaoran had firmly
                    believed that he should be the one to capture and inherit the Clow Cards, not Sakura
                    Kinomoto.[2]Syaoran
                    has short chestnut hair and large amber eyes. He appears to have grown in Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2:
                    The
                    Sealed Card and, later, the Clear Card series.</p>
